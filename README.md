Laborating and learning docker and containers with prev. schoolproject. Try to build infrastructure with the java-program and database.

Taking a finished pair-assignment I and my co-student wrote and connecting the database and script in my IDE to handle everything from there. In this project I want to understand how docker and containers works. I might try to write my own API using Springboot.
